## Clicking on the `<ul>` Element with ID "images":

- When you click on the list of images (`<ul>` element), it triggers its own event listener that is set to listen for click events during the bubbling phase.
  
- So, when you click on the `<ul>` element, it first triggers its own event listener, logging "clicked inside the ul".

- Then, because of event bubbling, the click event continues up through its parent elements. However, since there are no additional event listeners set on the parent elements in this code, nothing else happens.

## Clicking on the Image of the `Owl`:

- When you specifically click on the image of the owl, two things happen:

    1. **Event Triggers:** The event first triggers the event listener set directly on the owl image, logging "owl clicked".

    2. **Event Bubbling:** Then, due to event bubbling, the click event continues up through its parent elements.

- Because there is an event listener set on the `<ul>` element for click events during the bubbling phase, it gets triggered as well, logging "clicked inside the ul".

- In summary, clicking on the owl triggers actions both for the owl image itself and for the whole list of images it belongs to.
