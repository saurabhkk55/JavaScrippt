    // Capturing Phase: Event starts from the outermost element and moves towards the target element.

    // This is because the event listener attached to the outer div (`#outer`) is set to listen during the capturing phase. 
    // Therefore, when you click on the outer div, the event starts from the outermost element and moves towards the target element. 
    // There are no event listeners for the bubbling phase or for the target phase when clicking on the outer div, so those phases won't be logged.

    document.getElementById('inner').addEventListener('click', targetPhase);
    // If you click on the div with id "inner", the following output will be logged to the console:

    // Capturing Phase: Event starts from the outermost element and moves towards the target element.
    // Target Phase: Event reaches the target element.

    // This is because:
    // 1. The event starts in the capturing phase, as you have set the event listener for the outermost div (`#outer`) with the third argument `true`, which indicates capturing phase.
    // 2. Then, it moves to the target phase, as the event listener for the inner div (`#inner`) is in the default bubbling phase.

    // There won't be any output related to the bubbling phase because no event listeners are attached to elements that could capture events bubbling up from the target element.

    document.getElementById('target').addEventListener('click', bubblingPhase);
    // When you click on the "Click Me!" button, the following output will be logged to the console:

    // Capturing Phase: Event starts from the outermost element and moves towards the target element.
    // Target Phase: Event reaches the target element.
    // Bubbling Phase: Event bubbles up from the target element to the outermost element.

    // This is because:
    // 1. The event starts in the capturing phase, as you have set the event listener for the outermost div (`#outer`) with the third argument `true`, which indicates capturing phase.
    // 2. Then, it moves to the target phase, as the event listener for the inner div (`#inner`) is in the default bubbling phase.
    // 3. Finally, it bubbles up to the outermost div again in the bubbling phase due to the event listener on the button (`#target`).
