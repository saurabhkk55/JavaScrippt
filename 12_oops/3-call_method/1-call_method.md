# Understanding the `call` method in JavaScript

In given code, the `call` method is used to invoke the `setUsername` function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. **The `call` method allows you to use the context of one object in another object's method**. In this case, `setUsername.call(this, username)` is using the context of `createUser` in `SetUsername`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```javascript
function setUsername(username){
    this.username = username;
    console.log("Username has been set to: " + this.username);
    console.log("setUsername function is called.");
}

function createUser(username, email, password){
    setUsername.call(this, username);
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
}

const user_jacky = new createUser("jacky", "jacky@fb.com", "123");
console.log(user_jacky);
```
**Usage of `call()`**: By using `setUsername.call(this, username)`, we are explicitly setting the context (`this`) for the `setUsername` function. This is important because without doing this, this inside `setUsername` would refer to the global object (or undefined in strict mode), which is not what we want. By using `call()`, we ensure that this inside `setUsername` refers to the same object that is being constructed by the `createUser` function.

In the `createUser` function, `setUsername.call(this, username)` is called. The `call` method allows you to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. Here, `this` refers to the `createUser` function's context, and `username` is the argument passed to `SetUsername`.

The `setUsername` function sets the `username` property of the `this` context (which is the `createUser` function's context) and logs a message to the console.
