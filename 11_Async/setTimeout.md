# Asynchronous JavaScript and `setTimeout`.

Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is essential for managing tasks that might take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or executing time-consuming computations. One of the primary tools for handling asynchronous behavior in JavaScript is the `setTimeout` function.

### `setTimeout` Function

The `setTimeout` function allows you to schedule the execution of a function after a specified amount of time. Its basic syntax is:

```javascript
setTimeout(callbackFunction, delayInMilliseconds);
```

- `callbackFunction`: This is the function you want to execute after the specified delay.
- `delayInMilliseconds`: This is the time to wait before executing the function, measured in milliseconds.

## Here's an Example-1:

```javascript
console.log("Hello");
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("World");
}, 1000); // Output "Hello" immediately, then "World" after 1000ms (1 second)
```

Certainly! Let's break down what happens step by step:

1. `console.log("Hello");`: This line of code executes synchronously, meaning it runs immediately. It prints "Hello" to the console.

2. `setTimeout(() => { console.log("World"); }, 1000);`: This line schedules the callback function `() => { console.log("World"); }` to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). However, it doesn't wait for the delay to pass; instead, it continues to the next line of code.

3. `console.log("Galaxy");`: This line also executes synchronously, immediately after the `setTimeout` call. It prints "Galaxy" to the console.

Now, let's understand the timing:

- At time T=0 (start), "Hello" is printed synchronously.
- The `setTimeout` function is called, scheduling the execution of the callback function after 1000 milliseconds.
- "Galaxy" is printed synchronously after "Hello".
- Time passes. During this time, JavaScript continues to execute any other code it might have.
- At T=1000 milliseconds, the delay specified in `setTimeout` expires.
- The callback function `() => { console.log("World"); }` is pushed onto the event queue.
- The event loop picks up the callback function from the event queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
- Finally, "World" is printed to the console.

So, the output you see in the console will be:

```
Hello
Galaxy
World
```

This demonstrates the asynchronous nature of `setTimeout` and how it allows you to schedule code to run after a specified delay without blocking the execution of other code.


### Asynchronous Nature

The key thing to understand about `setTimeout` (and asynchronous JavaScript in general) is that it doesn't block the execution of other code. In the above example, even though we scheduled `console.log("World")` to run after 1000 milliseconds, JavaScript doesn't wait around doing nothing during that time. Instead, it continues executing any other code that follows.

### Event Loop

JavaScript engines, like the one in browsers or Node.js, employ an event-driven architecture with a mechanism called the event loop. The event loop manages the execution of code, handling asynchronous operations such as timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`), I/O operations, and more.

When you call `setTimeout`, the callback function is added to a queue after the specified delay. However, the event loop doesn't wait for this delay to pass. It continues to process other tasks in the meantime. Once the delay expires and the callback is due, the event loop moves the callback function from the queue to the call stack for execution.

### Conclusion

Understanding how `setTimeout` works is fundamental to mastering asynchronous JavaScript programming. It's crucial for building responsive and efficient web applications, especially when dealing with operations that may take an unpredictable amount of time to complete. Additionally, `setTimeout` is just one tool among many in JavaScript's asynchronous toolkit, including `promises`, `async/await`, and `event listeners`. By leveraging these tools effectively, you can write code that remains performant and responsive even when dealing with complex asynchronous tasks.

## Example - 2 important

```js
console.log("Hello");
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("World####");
}, 1000); // Output "Hello" immediately, then "World" after 1000ms (1 second)

for (let i=0; i<100000; i++) {
    console.log(`Galaxy-${i}`);
}
```

## Execution Breakdown:

1. `console.log("Hello");`: This line of code executes synchronously, printing "Hello" to the console immediately.

2. `setTimeout(() => { console.log("World####"); }, 1000);`: This schedules the callback function `() => { console.log("World####"); }` to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. The rest of the code doesn't wait for this delay and continues to execute.

3. `for (let i=0; i<100000; i++) { console.log(`Galaxy-${i}`); }`: This loop iterates 100,000 times and logs "Galaxy-" followed by the value of `i` to the console. This process is synchronous and might take some time to complete due to the large number of iterations.

### Detailed Execution:

- At the beginning, "Hello" is printed synchronously.
- Then, `setTimeout` is called, scheduling the execution of the callback function after 1000 milliseconds. However, the rest of the code continues to execute.
- The `for` loop starts executing, and for each iteration, it logs "Galaxy-" followed by the current value of `i` to the console.
- This loop execution is synchronous and might take a noticeable amount of time due to the large number of iterations (100,000).
- Meanwhile, time is passing, and after 1000 milliseconds, the delay specified in the `setTimeout` function expires.
- The callback function `() => { console.log("World####"); }` is pushed onto the event queue.
- Once the `for` loop completes, the event loop picks up the callback function from the event queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
- Finally, "World####" is printed to the console.

### Output:

The output might look something like this (depending on your console and environment):

```
Hello
Galaxy-0
Galaxy-1
...
Galaxy-99999
World####
```

Important point to remember:

1. When `setTimeout` is called, it schedules the callback function `() => { console.log("World####"); }` to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. This callback function is not immediately placed into the event queue. Instead, it's stored internally by the JavaScript engine until the specified delay has passed.

2. While the `setTimeout` callback is waiting, the `for` loop begins its execution. During each iteration of the loop, the messages "Galaxy-0", "Galaxy-1", ..., "Galaxy-99999" are printed synchronously to the console.

3. After 1000 milliseconds have passed, the delay specified in the `setTimeout` function expires. At this point, the callback function `() => { console.log("World####"); }` is ready to be executed.

4. However, before the callback function can be executed, it must first be placed into the event queue. This is because JavaScript is single-threaded and can only execute one piece of code at a time. The event queue holds tasks that are ready to be executed by the JavaScript event loop.

5. Once the `for` loop completes and the call stack becomes empty, the event loop will pick up the callback function from the event queue and push it onto the call stack for execution.

6. Finally, `World####` is printed to the console.

So, to clarify, the callback function is not immediately placed into the event queue when `setTimeout` is called. It's stored internally until the specified delay has passed, at which point it's placed into the event queue for eventual execution.
